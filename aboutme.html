        Hi! I'm Tom Bosman. <br /> Within this section of the Portfolio you will find an overview of the road I have travelled up until the point of development of this resource. Whilst not all of it has been positve, I would not change a thing, as these experiences have made me into who I am today.

    <p>During my time at St Columba's Catholic College, Springwood, I had the honour of being apart of a supportive and engaging educational institute that developed the whole person and their connection to God. The school provided a nurturing envrionment where I developed strongly academically, particularly in English, PDHPE, Ancient History and Biology. However, it was the practical, hands-on style of Industrial Technology Timber that I truly excelled in, securing the top marks for Years 10 and 11, and graduating with the top HSC mark in the school in Year 12, securing a Band 6 and a raw mark of 94. It was the time spent within the workshops that I developed a strong bond with my teacher, Mr Nick Prineas, a former Carpenter-turned-teacher who had a love for what he did which was infectious to his students. <br /> He would have a role to play in my life still...</p>

    </header>

    <p>Having worked with my Electrician father for close to 9 months before I had intended to take up an offer from Charles Sturt University - Bathurst to study Paramedicine, I began labouring with a few local builders/carpenters and fell in love with the hands-on aspects of interpeting plans, and building things, and in September of 2017, I formally started my 4.5 year trade apprenticeship under a popular Blue Mountains, Craig Gilchrist and his team. The next few years however, proved to be the toughest of my life.<br />I had made a mistake, and this line of work did not suit me, I was too slow, and was made to have a hard time by a few members of the team. At around the halfway point of my trade, I reconsidered my future profession, and it was here that I decided that after completing my apprenticeship, I would study teaching. It was something I had considered for a long time, but the lifestyle and rewarding nature of the teaching profession was really well sold to me via a 2.5 hour phone call with my old Woodwork teacher...Mr Prineas. <br /> What I did learn though, was invaluable knowledge surrounding all aspects of house construction, a plethora of hands-on skills and abilities, and a strong work ethic.</p>

    <p>During my time as an apprentice, I started my own Handyman business to help with my earning potential, it was this work that I then relied upon after completing my trade, leaving my employer and starting my degree. I worked on many different types of projects, ranging from decks, pergolas and internal fitouts, to lawn care and other landscaping jobs. I had a regular customer base of 20+ houses, and learnt invaluable time-management skills, quoting and invoicing skills, and I continued to develop my people-skills and conflict resolution.</p>

    <p>My ongoing study at ACU Strathfield has provided me with the opportunity to learn and grow my skills as I march towards finishing my degree. The blend of the Bachelor of Arts (Technology) and Bachelor of Education (Secondary) has allowed for a well-rounded experience thus far and has helped shape me into the educator I am today. The mix of theoretical principles and content, and the hands-on, practical learning has enabled me to become an adaptable learner who can appreciate each individual as a whole, regardless of skills, backgrounds, or prior dispositions.</p>

<p>During my time at ACU, I have enjoyed Professional Experiences at:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://fairfield-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/"><strong>Fairfield High School</strong></a></li> A challenging yet rewarding first experience of teaching that took me out of my sheltered, Blue Mountains upbringing. I taught Stage 5 & 6 Industrial Technology - Timber, and Stage 4 & 5 Engineering.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.stcolumbasspringwood.catholic.edu.au/"><strong>St Columba's Catholic College - Springwood</strong></a></li> My old high school, set within the beautiful, World-Heritage listed National Park and incorporating 150-year-old sandstone buildings. Here I taught VET Construction, Stage 4, 5 & 6 Industrial Technology - Timber, and Stage 5 & 6 Design and Technology.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mercychatswood.nsw.edu.au/"><strong>Mercy Catholic College - Chatswood</strong></a></li> Another old school that prides itself on developing independent, successful young women who seize every opportunity given to them. I was thronw in the deep-end here, and taught Industrial Technology - Multimedia, Stage 5 ICT, and Stage 4 & 5 Food Technology. </li>

    <p>Offered a job from Nick Prineas as the workshop manager, I ended up back at St Columba's once a week preparing material for Industrial Technology - Timber, and Design and Technology projects.</p>

<p>Since then, I have been:</p>

    <li><strong>TAS-specialist Assistant.</strong></li>
